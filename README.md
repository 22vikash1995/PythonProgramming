# Python Programming
# Note: <br/>
1.We can not concatenate the string value with the number like other programming language i.e "My Name is vikash and i am of"+25+"Years old".
 we can do this with the help of ''' format() ''' method.
# Difference between List ,Tuple ,Set and Dictionary in python?
Ans:<br/>
  **List**: List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.It allows duplicate members.<br/>
  **Tuple**: Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.It also allows duplicate members.<br/>
  **Set** : Set is a collection which is unordered ,unchangeable  and unindexed .It does not allow duplicate members.<br/>
  **Dictionary** : Dictionary is also a collection which is ordered and changeable.It allow duplicate members.<br/>
  **Note:** <br/>
  **Changeable** means we can add ,remove,items from the list after list creation.<br/>
  **Ordered** means that list's items have a defined order and that can not be changed. It means when we add new item to the list, item will be added at the end of list instead of other position.

 ** ***Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.**<br/>
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.**

2.# Difference between **__add__()** and **append()** functions.
Ans: **__add__()** method is used to concatenate two lists while **append()** function is used to add element in the last of existing list.
